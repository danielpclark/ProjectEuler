Both the Ruby and Rust version pass 4 out of 6 tests on [hackerrank.com](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges/euler001) .  I've
looked for a better way and have found [Use properties of prime numbers by Emily L.](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/90492/euler-3-largest-prime-factor/90503#90503).
Now this looks like it is helpful since it would improve performance by 300%, but
I'll admit I don't understand it at this time. -D.P.C. 12-3-16

Tried an alternate solution from a pattern a found in the steps of divisible numbers in
`ruby/solution2.rb`.  It worked but timed out on the same tests. -D.P.C. 12-3-16
